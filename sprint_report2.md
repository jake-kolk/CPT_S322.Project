## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
* We were able to complete all of our tasks
* We planned out how each task would generally be implemented 
* We collaborated to combine features created by different teammates 

Here's what we'd like to improve:
* Improve team coordination 
* Update the Kanban board more consistently 
* Have better planning 

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* More detailed descriptions of tasks on Kanban board
* Spend more time testing
* Meet more often
