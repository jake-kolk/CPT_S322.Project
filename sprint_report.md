## What's New (User Facing)
* Feature 1: Search API
* Feature 2: Search UI
* Feature 3: Integrated search tab in UI with API search tool.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint, we worked on getting the basics of the program running, adding a search UI, Search API, and integrating them both together. Because of Spring Break, we had trouble coordinating everything. But each person was assigned a different part of the sprint to do. With this, we were able to contribute to parts of the sprint to complete it.

## Unfinished Work
We were able to finish all features that were started in this sprint.

## Completed Issues/User Stories
Here are links to the issues that we completed in this sprint:
* https://github.com/JimKino/lab-agile-planning/issues/8 Search API, Jake Kolk

As a user I need to search for recipes based on food name so that I can easily cook the food I want
Acceptance Criteria: A list of recipes is shown after using the search API
Priority Level: High
Given the user is on the search tab
When the user enters a valid food name into the search bar
And hits the search button
Then a list of recipes with that name will be displayed

* https://github.com/JimKino/lab-agile-planning/issues/9 Search UI, Jim Kino

As a user I need a easy to use UI for the search So that I can use the program without confusion
Acceptance Criteria: There is a search UI that allows for searching
Priority Level: High
Given I open the program
When the program opens
Then there should be a UI that allows me to use the program

* https://github.com/JimKino/lab-agile-planning/issues/10 Integrated Search UI with API search, Gwyn Gras-Usry

As a user I need the Search to be implemented into the UI So that I am able to search from the UI
Acceptance Criteria: The program searches for recipes and displays it to the UI
Priority Level: High
Given I am on the search tab of the UI
When enter a recipe into the search of the UI
Then a list of recipes will be displayed to the UI

## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
We were able to finish all parts of the sprint we started.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
* We were able to coordinate different features to each person
* We had a clear goal for the current sprint
* We were able to work to achieve the current sprintâ€™s goal

Here's what we'd like to improve:
* Be able to work each feature independently, instead of one feature relying on the other
* Coordinate meetings and better to manage time better
* Use Kanban Board better

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* More clearly defined functions to implement
* Meet and plan what to do more often
* Test things more
